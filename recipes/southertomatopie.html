    <h1>Southern Tomato Pie</h1>

    <body>
        <p>
        Tomato slices are juicy and mix in well with the 
        creamy/cheesy "custard" in this Southern-inspired 
        tomato pie. The blind baking method helps keep the 
        crust nice and crunchy on the bottom.

    <h2>A refreshing summer dinner dish</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ (14.1 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 medium tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Fit pie crust inside a 9-inch pie plate, pressing into the bottom and up the sides of the plate. Fold crust edges under; crimp as desired.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Carefully remove parchment paper and pie weights. Continue baking until crust is light golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, slice tomatoes crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices; arrange tomato slices in a single layer on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Whisk together mayonnaise and cream cheese until combined and smooth. </li>
        <li>Spread half of the Cheddar mixture in the pie crust. Layer with 1/3 of the tomato slices in slightly overlapping circles. </li>
